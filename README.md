Gridded Migration through Birth and Death Registration Data with GHSL:
Employing gridded birth and death registration data, in conjunction with the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), to assess migration patterns at a fine-grained spatial scale. By analyzing disparities in birth and death rates, our approach enables the identification of regions experiencing significant population movements. The integration of GHSL data enhances our understanding of urbanization and its influence on migration dynamics.

Migration Assessment through High-Frequency Data:
Completing with high-frequency data sources, including nightlights and temperature data at a fine-grained grid level, to assess migration dynamics. By applying machine learning models to these datasets, we gain a detailed understanding of short-term population movements and their correlation with environmental and socioeconomic factors. Our approach contributes to a more nuanced understanding of migration at a microscale level.

Systematic Review of Machine Learning Studies on Global Migration:
This systematic review examines the application of machine learning techniques in studies related to global migration. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, we identify common methodologies, challenges, and advancements in this field. Our synthesis of these studies provides valuable insights into the use of machine learning for migration assessment on a global scale.

Indian Hotspot Migration Using Railway Data:
This study explores migration hotspots in India by utilizing railway data as a proxy for mobility. Through machine learning algorithms, we identify key railway routes and stations associated with significant migration flows. The analysis offers valuable insights into the factors influencing internal migration patterns within India, shedding light on socioeconomic drivers and regional disparities.
